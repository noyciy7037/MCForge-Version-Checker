# Mods Version Checker
Check the version of the client-side mods for vulnerability countermeasures, etc.

## How to use
1. Put the body in the mods file.
2. The Log4Shell countermeasure works.

Option:
1. Modify the config/mods_version_checker.cfg file.

Nothing happens when you introduce it to a client.
